1. Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.

  An RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is a tool (some mechanism/software) used to manage digital database. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the 'language' (system of interaction) used to tell a database management system/software what to do.

2. Why do tables need a primary key?

  The primary key serves as the primary, unique identifier for an individual row (entry) in a database. The uniqueness provided by primary keys ensure that there will always be a way to tell any two distinct rows in a table apart from one another.

  3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

    A foreign key.

4. What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

  Many to many relationships between two tables mean that rows in Table A references multiple rows in Table B and vice-versa.

  Example of a many to many relationship: An order can have many products and the some product
  can be/appear in many orders.
